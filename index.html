                <h3>17) Binding Arbitration</h3>
                <p>If a dispute arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Platform (a "Dispute"), either party may elect to resolve it by binding arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), administered by JAMS under its applicable rules (available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com" target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com</a>). Arbitration may be conducted in person, by documents, by phone, or online. If in person, it will occur in the U.S. county where you reside. Each party pays JAMS fees as required by JAMS rules. The arbitrator's decision is final (subject to limited FAA appeal rights), and judgment may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. Either party may seek provisional remedies in court to aid arbitration.</p>
                <p><strong>30-Day Opt-Out.</strong> You may opt out of this arbitration agreement within 30 days of first accepting these Terms by emailing <a href="mailto:diorakushal@gmail.com">diorakushal@gmail.com</a> with subject line "Arbitration Opt-Out," and including your full name, username (if any), the email associated with your account, and a clear statement that you opt out of arbitration.

                <h3>18) Class Action Waiver</h3>
                <p>All proceedings to resolve disputes will be conducted only on an individual basis. You agree not to bring or participate in a class, consolidated, or representative action or arbitration.</p>

                <p>You acknowledge that your breach of Sections 4‚Äì5 (IP; User Content) may cause irreparable harm. We may seek injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction without posting a bond.</p>
                
                <h3>20) Miscellaneous</h3>
                <p>If any provision is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be replaced with a valid term that most closely reflects the original intent, and the remainder will remain in effect. Our failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver. These Terms (plus any policies referenced, including the Privacy Policy) are the entire agreement between you and BETS regarding the Platform and supersede all prior agreements. Section headings are for convenience only. These Terms inure to the benefit of our successors and assigns. Language. The parties request that these Terms be drafted in English.</p>
