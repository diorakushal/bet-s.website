                <p>Privacy and security are very important to us at BETS ("BETS," "we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use our platform (the "Platform"), which includes our website and mobile app. BETS provides a community for sports fans to share their betting activity, follow friends, and engage socially. Please read this Policy carefully.</p>
